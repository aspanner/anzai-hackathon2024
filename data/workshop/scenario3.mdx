As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the Acme Financial Services data science team, who have been training models on their laptops.
The team have given you access to one of their models in the ACME Financial Services object storage and want to see how this could be deployed to a cluster running in the cloud.


## 3.1 - Replicate Model to Cloud Storage

For this task, your team are required to use the `granite-7b-lab` model available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio.

After locating the model in on premises object storage, your team need to replicate this model to the ACME Financial Services cloud cluster object storage so that it could be served in future.


## 3.2 - Install openshift ai

Now that you've helped the ACME team replicate their chosen model to their cloud OpenShift Cluster, they want to serve the model ASAP.

For this challenge your team must demonstrate to ACME how to install OpenShift AI, and serve the existing model called `granite-7b-lab` via OpenShift AI.
