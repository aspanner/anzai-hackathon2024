summary: "Can you speedrun the deployment of a model?"
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the entire ACME Financial Services data science team, who up to this point have been developing and deploying models on their laptops and want to see how easy it is to deploy a model from object storage within OpenShift AI.

This would be an ideal opportunity as a sales team to demo the deployment of an [IBM Granite model available from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/instructlab/granite-7b-lab).

There's good news and bad news. Good news first, last night you put a copy of the chosen demo model `granite-7b-lab` into minio based object storage on your demo cluster. The bad news, you slept in this morning and now you've only got 30 minutes to get the rest of your demo ready! Can you make it happen???!!

## 3.1 - Examine your object storage

For this task, your team are required to use the `granite-7b-lab` model available in the minio object storage running in your team cluster.

Examine the model storage bucket. You'll need to locate the `route` for minio and the login credentials - which are available in a `secret`.

You quickly note down the bucket name and directory path you chucked the model into as you know you'll need that shortly to deploy it.

## 3.2 - Install OpenShift AI required operators

With your chosen demo model ready in object storage, it's time to serve the model ASAP!

For the first part of this challenge your team must demonstrate to ACME how to install OpenShift AI, and serve the existing model called `granite-7b-lab` via OpenShift AI.

Install the following operators (**do not create any operator custom resources**)

- OpenShift AI
- OpenShift Service Mesh
- OpenShift Serverless

## 3.3 - Install OpenShift AI

Wait until the three operators specified in the previous section have fully installed, before proceeding. You won't need any Custom Resources for OpenShift Service Mesh and OpenShift Serverless

At this point you know you need to create a `DataScienceCluster` for OpenShift AI. A fast strategy would be to open the yaml view and go with all the defaults - the only addition to be to add this `knative-serving-cert` secret.

```yaml
spec:
 components:
   kserve:
     managementState: Managed
     serving:
       ingressGateway:
         certificate:
           secretName: knative-serving-cert
           type: SelfSigned
       managementState: Managed
       name: knative-serving
```

## 3.4 - Set up your OpenShift AI project and workbench

An OpenShift AI project maps directly to an OpenShift project, enjoying the same RBAC and isolation capailities.

OpenShift AI Workbenches pertain to a base container image, encapsulating a particular toolset used by the data scientists, e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow etc.

Time to finish this demo prep, you OpenShift AI and do the following:

- create a project named `model-speedrun`
- create a workbench `model-speedrun-wb` that:
  - uses `Pytorch` as a basis
  - uses a `Large` container size
  - uses a Persistent Volume of at least `80GB`
  - uses a Data Connection to your minio object storage

## 3.5 - Service the model

vLLM is a popular model server format whose APIs are compatible with Open AI (Chat GPT) APIs. This format then lends itself to easy migration of apps already using Open AI - to OpenShift AI. For your demo you will use **Single Model Serving**.

Add a vLLM model server called `model-speedrun` that uses a data connection to your cluster's object storage and the subfolder of its `models` bucket that contains your Granite model.

### 3.6 - Make an inference call to your model

Anxiously watching the clock in your laptops taskbar you wait the five minutes or so for your model server to become ready with an inference URL so you can test everything is working before you join the call with the ACME Financial Services team.

Free hint: the Fast API (Swagger) interface is a quick and effective way to make the test inference call (no Authorisation or credentials should be necessary).

## 3.7 - Check your work

To complete this challenge, take a screenshot showing Fast API inference call and response payload which should include an `OK 200`.

Once done, please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` with the screenshot and message:

> Please review [team name] solution for exercise 3.

This exercise is worth `750k`. If you engage the services of the contractor (by obtaining a hint from the hackathon moderators), it will cost you `25k`, which will be deducted from the respective challenge's deal value to your team.
The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total deal size.
