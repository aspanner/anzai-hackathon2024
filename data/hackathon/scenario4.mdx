Thanks you to your slick troubleshooting and earlier demo's the ACME Financial Services data science team are underway with the OpenShift AI Proof of Concept and are now stuck with a workbench problem.

The ACME team has been using the `Standard Data Science` workbench image with `Python 3.9` and are now trying to enable additional libraries for their entire team.

While experimenting they were completing this with a `pip install` inside their Jupyter Notebooks. They now need these libraries to be baked into their workbench images, so they can standardise on tooling across the team.

One of our big sales pitches to the team earlier in the sales cycle was how easy it would be for them to integrate their own open source tooling into OpenShift AI, now the rubber has hit the road we need to show them how it's done.

## 4.1 - Review notebook requiring custom libraries

Fire up an OpenShift AI workbench named `open-innovation`, using the `Standard Data Science` base image and launch/run the notebook https://github.com/odh-labs/hackathon/blob/main/temp/scenario4_open_innovation/custom-image.ipynb

Running the notebook cells you will see it fails currently due to missing library `pypdf`.

## 4.2 - Build custom workbench image

Your first challenge after reviewing the failing notebook is to build a custom workbench image that the ACME team can import and use as an example which would include the missing `pypdf` library.

You have 2 options:

1) Use a Build Config and push the image as an `imagestream` into the  `redhat-ods-applications` namespace.
2) Use Podman to build a container locally and push to internal OpenShift image registry or Quay.io, then add it to OpenShift AI through the web interface.

Your custom image name should be `acme-workbench-ai-custom`

Documentation you may find helpful is:

- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cicd/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html
- https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib/workbench-images

## 4.3 - Ensure image is present in the internal registry

After building an image, you'll need to ensure the image is present in the internal OpenShift image registry.

Documentation you may find helpful is:

- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/registry/index.html
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html

## 4.4 - Verify image is imported into OpenShift AI

Your newly imported image should be visible in the `Image selection` dropdown within the Workbench tab inside your OpenShift AI

## 4.5 - Check your work

If your ACME Financial Services custom image  `acme-workbench-ai-custom` is available in the dropdown and starting successfully please post a screenshot of it to `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` with the message:

> Please review [team name] solution for exercise 4.

This exercise is worth `750k`. If you engage the services of the contractor (by obtaining a hint from the hackathon moderators), it will cost you `25k`, which will be deducted from the respective challenge's deal value to your team.
The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total deal size.
