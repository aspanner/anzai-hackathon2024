The ACME Financial Services team are underway with the OpenShift AI Proof of Concept and are now stuck with a workbench problem.
The ACME has been using the `Standard Data Science` workbench image with Python 3.9 and are now trying to enable additional libraries for their entire team.
While experimenting they were completing this with a `pip install` insde their Jupyter Notebooks. They now need these libraries to be baiked into their workbench images, so they can standardise on tooling across the team.

As the pre-sales team, you've offered to show how this is done.


## 4.1 - Review notebook requiring custom Python library with in an existing workbench
Fire up an OpenShift AI workbench, using the `Standard Data Science` base image and launch/run the Notebook https://github.com/odh-labs/hackathon/blob/main/temp/scenario4_open_innovation/custom-image.ipynb
You see it fails due to missing mibrary pypdf


## 4.2 - Build custom workbench image
Your first task after reviewing the failing scenario to build a custom image and deploy it as am Image Stream into the cluster (it should go in the redhat-ods-applications)
